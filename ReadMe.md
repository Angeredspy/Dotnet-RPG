# DotNet WebApp Backend

## Within this project, I Build the back-end of a .NET 7 web application with a Web API, Entity Framework 7 & SQL Server. 

### The WEB API I create utilizes: 

* Standard Create, Read, Update & Delete operations.
* Corrersponding HTTP Request methods that Get, Post, Put & Delete.
* The Model, View & Controller design pattern (Service intermediary also utilized to avoid fat controllers).
* Dependency Injection, asynchronus operations & Data Transfer Objects (DTO's).
